### Installation on Windows

#### 1) Downloading the Executable

![By Clicking the link above download the .exe file](images/git-installation.JPG)<br/>
<small>Just bash the Next button and you should be good, the git installer already has the recommended settings ticked (Hopefully)</small>

#### 2) Initialization

Go to your ```
C:/users/{whatever-your-username-is}``` <br />
<small>Or really wherever you want to :/ </small><br/><br />
Right Click and you should see this: <br /> <br />

Now if everything worked out quite well, you should see the Git Bash option, if it didn't you'd need some additional help so inquire someone who knows what they're talking about or start surfing the interwebs for your answer. :surfer:<br /> <br />

Open up Git Bash by clicking on it and you should see this particular looking command prompt imposter: <br /><br />

Type in these commands to setup the username: <br/>
```git config --global user.name "{your-username}"``` <br />
<small>(For very obvious reasons I don't need to say outloud you should substitute {your-username} for your username)</small>

Type in these commands to setup the email id: <br/>
```git config --global user.email "{your-email}"``` <br />
<small>(Use the email you used to register your GitHub account)</small>

Now there are other tricks and tips you can do to setup your environment in a million ways like change your ui color but that won't be written here, here's a cheat sheet if you like that sort of thing: https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/

<small>There's really two ways you can go from here on out, if you want to create your own repo from the get-go (3a) or if you want to clone another person's work and work on top of it (3b)</small>

#### 3a) Creating a repository 

1. Create new folder
